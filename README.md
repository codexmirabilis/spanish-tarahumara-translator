# Spanish-to-Tarahumara Translator

The purpose of the present work is to contribute with a “grain of 
sand” to the preservation of Mexican native languages by developing translation tools that 
would enable non-bilingual native speakers to have access to the vast amount of information 
already available in the Spanish language.
